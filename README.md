Last Revision : 17 January 2015

SmartHome ([check the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_fc6otGhpU) and [the second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAViTllGdyo)) is a service built for fun which allow you to add dynamically actions and control any IoT devices who run at least one REST API service.

The first version was built in less than 5 hours using Polymer. Tests were made on Philips Hue and Tessel.

#Have fun !

##Possibilities are limitless :
You can interact with any RESTful API service

For exemple, controlling an AC is very simple ! Take a Tessel, put an IR blaster on it and control it through SmartHome (and put a climate sensor if you want to activate the AC when the temperature is below or over a value)

### TO DO :

Lot of improvments will come in few days in order to make the plateform smarter. Here is some of them :
1. Release a PHP & pure JavaScript version of the backend
2. Add interactions with websockets
3. Make the "sentence system" smarter
